# VarnaConf 2015 Demo App

This is a simple app with that shows off Ember.js. It was used as a demo at [VarnaConf 2015](http://varnaconf.com/archive/2015). There are five git tags that show the app at various stages of its development:

- [01-beginning](/tree/01-beginning)
- [02-initial-routes](/tree/02-initial-routes)
- [03-working-comment-form-slider](/tree/03-working-comment-form-slider)
- [04-registration-form](/tree/04-registration-form)
- [05-registration-wizard](/tree/05-registration-wizard)

The tags are not very linear, unfortunately, there was a lot of branching out and correcting. Still, they're what I used to show the logical evolution of the app, even if they aren't perfectly chronological.

The presentation is published [here](https://speakerdeck.com/andrewradev/ember-dot-js-za-old-school-web-proghramisti-varnaconf-2015), but the slides themselves are not particularly instructive without the talking :).
